# Facilitate the use of the evolution model.
The files can give you an idea of how to make an evaluation to determines whether a pair of reactions is evolvable. This notebook requires the use of Tensorflow, Keras, and RDKit.

# File details
Model_3x3 : Final model used for evaluation purposes
Evolution_SingleStepScore_GitHub : Example code to demonstrate how to use the model
