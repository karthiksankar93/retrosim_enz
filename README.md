# retrosim_enz
Enzymatic retrosynthesis by similarity as published in XX.

The repository is divided into 'Directed evolution score' and 'Retrosynthesis'. Each component has the code necessary for using the developed algorithm and the code associated with developing + testing the techniques.

The associated datasets are also available in '.pkl' format. As backup, all datasets are also available in '.csv' format as well. In the '.csv' format, columns with lists were converted to string; therefore, look into from ast import literal_eval to reconvert the string to list.
